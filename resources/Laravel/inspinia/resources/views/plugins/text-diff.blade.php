On a rainy Monday morning in a small town, Emma walked into her favorite café, her umbrella dripping and her hair slightly frizzy from the storm. She always ordered the same thing: black coffee, two sugars, and a blueberry muffin. But today, someone was already sitting at her usual table by the window. It was Jack — a quiet man with a book in hand and headphones around his neck. Their eyes met for a second. He smiled and motioned for her to join him. Hesitant but intrigued, Emma accepted.
